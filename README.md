## Quick setup

1. Install:
   ```bash
   npm install

2. Start:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   Open the app via:

   * Expo Go (quick test)
   * Development build
   * Android Emulator / iOS Simulator

3. Reset project (optional):

   ```bash
   npm run reset-project
   ```

   Moves starter code to `app-example` and creates a fresh `app/`.

## Project structure (high level)

```
/app
  /(auth)         # login, signup screens
  /(main)         # dashboard, home, tabs
  /transactions   # transaction list + card components
  /events         # event listing + event detail
  /social         # community feed, post composer
  /profile        # profile + settings
/api
  auth.js         # auth routes
  users.js
  posts.js
  events.js
  transactions.js
```

## Backend notes (recommended)

* Use **Node.js + Express** for APIs.
* Store users, events, posts, and transactions in **MongoDB**.
* Protect routes with JWT middleware.
* For image uploads use `multer` and store either in cloud (S3) or as accessible file URLs.

---

## Built with

* React Native (Expo Router)
* Node.js + Express (backend)
* MongoDB (database)
* JWT (authentication)
* Axios (API requests)

---

## Tips for polishing

* Add input validation on forms and show inline errors.
* Use optimistic UI updates for transactions and posts.
* Add better offline handling for the wallet (cache last-known balance).
* Add unit tests for critical API endpoints (auth, transactions, events).
